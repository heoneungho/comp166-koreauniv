= Introduction =

This is a program for Tic Tac Toe game written in C#. It has a built in Computer Player module and can be even played in two player mode. It can be run anywhere where JRE is installed. The source is compatible NetBeans.



= Background =

During my exploration of Java and C#, I found some interesting similarities and differences and ultimately learned that with study of one of them, the other one can also be learned. This program is my attempt to demonstrate the same to beginners in programming.

= Using the Code  =

{{{
int[][] pos=new int[3][3];
    int cnt,val,a,b,c=1,d=1,diff=1,vs=1;
    char let;
    String pl1="You",pl2="Computer";
    Random rnd=new Random();
    boolean turn=true;
}}}
